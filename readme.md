# Sorting algorithms benchmark

This repository contains the code that was used to analyse the time complexity of various sorting algorithms for the Methods and Practices in Informatics class of the second semester, first year.

9. <b>Shell Sort</b> (source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shellsort/)

### Results

The point of this project was to create a formal paper on the analysis of the performance of some sorting algorithms. The implementation of each algorithm was not relevant for the problem, they just needed to sort correctly. This is why I chose to take the algorithms from the Internet instead of writing them on my own, in order to prevent any bugs that could have occurred.
